After the PHP piscine, this ensures that am able to apply what i have learned: I have created, in PHP, a small Instagram-like site that enables users to make and share photo edits. I have thus implemented, with bare hands (frameworks are forbidden), basic functionalities i find on most sites with a user database.

- I used MVC for project structure
- PHP OOP to use and reuse my code check model, and view folders.
- I used PDO to connect to the database check model folder.
- Ajax to handle request to PHPcheck rsc/js folder
- HTML5 localstorage API
- Sends emails to clinets
- Forgot Password feature
- User Manangement (Registration and Login)
- getUserMedia API for camera capturing
- Image Editing (Merging stickers with the uploaded or Webcam image)
- Pagination using Javascript
...

# In order to run this project go to config/database.php change username and password maybe a server address as well and after run the script on config/setup.php after you can run the index.php file in any browser.
